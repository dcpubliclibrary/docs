## Creating accessions in ArchivesSpace

Before you begin, you must create an accession stub. Click on the gear icon>Plug-ins>Next Accession. You will be prompted to enter the year of accession in YYYY format. Always enter the current year (e.g. 2021). Once you have done so, hit Enter. The system will then assign you the next accession number in line for that year. On the next page, do not alter the ID field, but go ahead and enter the accession title (a placeholder is okay at this stage, we'll correct it in the next step), and click Submit. You'll then be taken to your stub accession record, where you can begin entering more detailed information. Click Edit.

Add the following fields:

- TITLE
    
    The title should be the donor's full name in indirect order ("Jones, Bob" NOT "Bob Jones").

- IDENTIFIERS 1 and 2

    These fields will hold the accession number. Enter the 4 digit year in Identifier 1; the second number should autopopulate.

- ACCESSION DATE

    Field should autopopulate with the current date.

- CONTENT DESCRIPTION

    Enter a few sentences on the materials that make up the accession: what they are, the amount of materials, and what they are about. Do not use abbreviations.

- CONDITION DESCRIPTION

    Enter any notes about deterioration or other preservation problems or challenges. Do not use abbreviations.

- GENERAL NOTES

    Enter any descriptive information not included in the Content Description or Condition Description. This could include important information about the material's provenance or how it came to the collection. Do not use abbreviations.

- ACQUISITION TYPE

    Usually Gift.Purchase if purchased or created as a service (ex: digitization by a vendor) or Transfer if created by Special Collections or another division of DC Public Library (Ex: some oral histories).

- DATES

    Add a creation date. This is the date the materials were created, not what time period they are about (for example a recent book about the Civil War should have a creation date of 2012, not 1861-1865). Note that all dates should use format YYYY-MM-DD. If day is unknown, use YYYY-MM; if only the year is known, use YYYY.
    
    Use Label, Type (Always Bulk or Inclusive), Begin, End, and Certainty fields as applicable.

- EXTENTS

    Extent is used to describe the size of an accession using the Portion, Number and Type fields. The Portion should almost always be "Whole," meaning that the entire accession is described in a single Extent record. "Linear feet" should be used for the Extent Type for most traditional archival collections and Number is used to count the number of linear feet of records accessioned. Add broad descriptive information about the container contents in Container Summary.

- AGENT LINKS

    Add or create a Source Agent for the donor. A Creator Agent should also be added for the creator of the bulk of the intellectual content of an accession if the accession/collection is almost exclusively the work of one person, family, or organization.  

    To create a new Agent:

    1. Click the "+" at the bottom of the Agent module to add a new agent.  

    2. Select "Creator" or "Subject" and from the Role dropdown.  

    3. Select "Create" from the Agents drop down and click "Person," "Family," or "Corporate Entity" as applicable.
