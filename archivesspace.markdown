## Introduction

ArchivesSpace (ASpace) is a web-based application that can be accessed from any computer, laptop, or device with an internet connection. This workflow covers the fields ASpace requires for the creation of Resources. If you have questions please ask a Digital Curation Librarian.

Resources record information about the intellectual and physical characteristics of archival materials, as well as contextual information about creators and topics. 

## Logging In, Selecting a Repository, Browsing, and Searching

1.  Navigate to the staff backend of ASpace: <https://dcplaspace.wrlc.org/staff>

2.  Login using your account  credentials.

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/cCLnBOoSygArssShEPnhRkFhJTNcQLxSlEhhuLiZp9MvQEbu22RpBQvJkdBv1twmWztwHWhpZMNuoAVisy9VBkj20gpsiR8DVKBQb1PQg3WslSQIexMZfESYvloOQi5U-ThkKufr)

1.  Select a Repository - this is the physical location of the materials:

-   MLK

-   Stage

-   Peabody

-   Stage - this is a sandbox, play around to your heart's content - you'll alter nothing on the public site. Create Resources in Stage and when you're ready to publish Transfer to the desired Repository. See a Digital Curation Librarian when the time comes to transfer.

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/y18JgXzmdsKGA0DNBz9k08crmgx4i853q78TBZuiE49EjpyY87NAZKa-CxBkZQg2O5jycxR_QsQZZAD35A8UUCVJnQxsRpqDTwbBAjsvBHA_-yOL3UO-R0W1AhVar-6OwivbFDhr)

1.  View already created Resources by clicking the Browse tab and selecting Resources. By default, the list of Resource records sorts by the date the record was created. You can reorder by using the Sort by: feature in the right corner above the list of collections.![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/E4WlQcsNhtbYfQoJeNTd5tr6j_NWPPCwpWe8vyWBvsH7spvci3bpiYNVzaaAbhinUu3B8vtxAFSPQzHJ1HjJKz4V1yLH4QoqEEvSHppwKoAN4HbHVbj2Q5zEIao5oPGIa1MZ7l4B)

2.  Before creating a new Resource search records to avoid duplication. 

-   Click the expander (V) for advanced search.

-   Refine to just Resources with Record Type in the left margin\
![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/s1dFfbGFgZUy0CUhgEDsHTyRDF-taGbYVazeiprxN0pjJ4l3DFwOl0WtCYZuopeb_1588CUY2O1mX32iKjRfrK-owPog1v2HhttLPMns1SFk1kjMlCbYnTBBQvGme6gKzr7hsDbO)

## Creating a Resource

## Manual Data Entry vs. Load via Spreadsheet

-   Manual Data Entry: Create the entire Resource hierarchy (Parent, Child, Sibling) one component at a time, entering all data as you go. 

-   Load via Spreadsheet: Create just the top level Collection component and use the ASpace ingest template to batch load all Child and Sibling components. 

## Creating a Resource with Manual Data Entry![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/XZ95CuylLtKHtpqyeb31wPrEE3fVsgXAeSHdtwrGBbBw5eR3E6aR4UPKBm0R3VUvY0C9O2-JsiYt5DKD2o_7EJTFM8x9uYhabuJy8pHl2oVw1_AF9hQldYT815oZLSp816p0C6Kb)

1.  Avoid duplication! Search each individual Repository for Resources and Accessions before creating a new one. Do not create duplicate records!

2.  When you're sure there are no duplicate records click the Create tab and select Resource

## Top Level Component Fields

The top level of a Resource is where the majority of the intellectual and physical information about a collection is stored. This is the top hierarchical level for your Resource that all other components (Child and Sibling) will nest under.

Although many fields are not required, please fill in as much information as possible. All required fields are noted with a red asterisk (*) Save your work frequently as you go!

## Adding a Child Component

ASpace collections are modular, they are constructed of blocks of information. The blocks have a familial relationship: Parent, Sibling, and Child. You just added the the top Collection level which is a Parent. The Child level is one hierarchy level down from its parent. The Sibling level is a parallel level to a Child.

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/oxHvGw_MJjvObceBKn1rEtfH8EwbBZ_rM1s__RcpskgFr8VE_s9OAjslk7-iBgAXGWyqOG2_WrDD__CatsXFK__8ytuqAhfWKffiYH-KkHjR4rtU2CRq8OfsBm74SeJVzZdca7r_)

1.  Click Add Child: You must be in the top Parent level to add the Child (highlighted in blue above)

-   Note: The top Parent level will change depending on where you are in the hierarchy. Example: See the image above, the top Parent level to add File Cat Naps, 2016 is Series 1: Photographs, 2016-2019. 

## Basic Information

1.  Start with Level of Description: Required.

-   Collection: DO NOT USE for child. Collection is a Parent top level. 

-   Item: Itemized list of a single folder.

-   File: A single letter or single folder collection.

-   Series: A record series.

-   Sub-Series: A series within a series.

-   Other Level: A level that is not listed. This should be used very rarely. Select Other Level then define the level. 

-   Example: If creating a list of boxes without inventoried folders, you could select Other Level and set the level as box.

3.  Title: Required. Titles of the Series (Example: Series 1: Photographs).

4.  Component Unique Identifier: Not required. 

5.  Language: Not required. DO NOT fill in the Language. This will duplicate information at the top level of the collection.

6.  Publish?: Not required. DO NOT check the Publish? box until the finding aid is complete! 

7.  Restrictions Apply?: Not required. DO NOT apply restrictions at the component level. If a series, item, etc.is restricted, note the restriction at the collection level. 

8.  Repository Processing Note: Not required. DO NOT use the Repository Processing Note field at the component level. Add any Repository Processing Notes to the collection level. 

## Dates

1.  Label: Required. Leave the date Label as Creation. 

2.  Type: Required. Dates may be entered three different ways:

-   Single Date: Select Single from the Type. Enter the date in the Begin field.

-   Date Range: Select Inclusive Dates from the Type. Enter the dates in the Begin and End fields. 

-   Date Range with Bulk Date: If the collection is a date range, but a majority of the materials are from a date range within the larger range, select Inclusive Dates and complete step above. THEN, click on Add Date and select Bulk Dates. Enter the Begin and End bulk dates in the fields. 

4.  Certainty: Add if applicable. Should only be used to qualify date information as potential unclear.

5.  Era: Not required. Period during which years are numbered and dates reckoned, such as B.C. or C.E. The value C.E. is the default.

## Adding Additional Child Components

Adding an additional Child creates a lower level in the hierarchy. If you want to add a parallel level, add a Sibling. When to add a lower level:

-   Add a Sub-series to a Series

-   Add a folder to a series

-   Add an item to a folder

1.  Make sure the Child component you want to add a Child to is highlighted.

2.  Click Add Child 

3.  Repeat steps above for [Adding A Child Component](https://docs.google.com/document/d/119JBkoKKtmhGbY2JZ19KmMF-L3sBd2ChOoG5Y2QvUO8/edit#heading=h.xooah87iyin2)

## Adding Sibling Components

Sibling components are parallel levels in the hierarchy. For example adding additional Series, Sub-series, or Folder. If you want to add a lower level add an additional Child. 

1.  Make sure the Parent component you want to add a Sibling to is highlighted. 

2.  Click Add Sibling

3.  Repeat steps above for [Adding A Child Component](https://docs.google.com/document/d/119JBkoKKtmhGbY2JZ19KmMF-L3sBd2ChOoG5Y2QvUO8/edit#heading=h.xooah87iyin2) (steps are the same for Sibling)

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/eN35WQgeT-70ypP46_WPaaDoH36ueEegGA2frQvvzf6Fr3nmZTGgdJKZVl2Xs4xUaEomb3YrPC-ll9Afh5tTv4juodb-NnfqFAMgta0kf3mCrbUh4_Nwv2uUhMsBkNhTr6XsMUKV)

## Creating a Resource with Load Via Spreadsheet

-   ASpace allows for a bulk import of Child and Sibling components, hurray! 

-   To use this feature the top level Collection component must first be created in ASpace before the spreadsheet may be ingested. 

-   Follow the steps above on [Top Level Component Fields](https://docs.google.com/document/d/119JBkoKKtmhGbY2JZ19KmMF-L3sBd2ChOoG5Y2QvUO8/edit#heading=h.hmtw6jy5twg7)

-   Do not add Child or Sibling levels, the spreadsheet ingest will handle these levels. 

## Prepping the Spreadsheet for Ingest

Although many fields are not required, please fill in as much information as possible. Required fields are in red. The fields are broken into sections.

1.  Open the aspace_import_excel_template.xlsx file I:\DigitalProjects\ASpace

2.  Save a working copy to I:\DigitalProjects\ASpace\Working_Copies

-   DO NOT save over the template!

-   File naming convention: YYYYMMDD Upload Date_FindingAidTitle_aspace_import.xlsx

-   Example: 20190906_CatMordecaiT_aspace_import.xlsx

### Resources Identifying Information

1.  EAD ID: Required. The EAD ID must be on every row. 

## Archival Object Basic Information

1.  Title: Required. The title of the level being entered such as Series, Sub-Series, ect.

2.  Component Unique Identifier: Not required. May be used to add file name if applicable. 

3.  Hierarchical Relationship: Required. These numbers denote the hierarchical level of the row of information, and the row's relationship to those below and above. The first row must always be 1.
